-following the tuto vid 1, used the ucup sprite but cut the south-facing sprite
 to fit into the GODOT maximum sprite width limit (16384)
-unlike the vid, didnt change the project settings window size to accomodate 
 small pixel art size, but retain the Stretch and Test Width
-following tuto vid 2
-following tuto vid 3, change the MAX_SPEED on the player script to accomodate
 the sprite being quite big, smoother walking speed
-following tuto vid 4, change the size of the bush & collision to better fit
 the size of the player sprite
-following tuto vid 5&6
-tried some spritework but got problems with offset, using the cutted og file for
 now
